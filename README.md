This project are my notes on learning REACT.  It's largely from the Pluralsight course "React:Getting started"

COURSE OVERVIEW
- pre-reqs are just basic javascript

THE BASICS
- Introduction
  - using Hooks and Class components

- Why REACT
  - A javascript library for building user interfaces
  - Frameworks vs libraries
  - good for building ios mobile apps
  - Created and supported by Facebook

- React's Basic concepts
  - components (functions or class)
  - Reactive updates
  - Virtual views in memory. Generate HTML using javascript
  - JSX is not HTML

- Your First React Component
  - We'll create a Button with a numeric label that increases each time you click on it
  - webtool for course: jscomplete.com/playground.  This was built with React
  - type javascript into the playground
     eg.
     document.getElementById('mountNode').innerHTML = 'Hello';
 - works with: React, ReactDOM,  JSX,  ES2015+
 - Load React devtools extensio in your browser
 - https://jscomplete.com/playground/rgs1.1
 - JSX is a javascript extension
 - Babel  is a javascript compiler that turns JSX into REACT API calls
 - Everything that gets displayed in REACT is a Component

- Your first React hook
  - the useState function is known as a 'hook' in REACT
  -

- You firs one way data flow
  - This is all about defining variables and functions in a parent function and passing them down to child function
  - responsibility isolation

- Component re-usability
  - changing button value and creating more values

- Tree Reconciliation in action
  -use the setInterval function to display how react behaves to regeneration of a page.   It doesn't overwrite text placed in an input box

- Wrap UP
  - Summarize all the items above that we've learned
